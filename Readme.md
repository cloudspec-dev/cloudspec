# Hekto Cloud Spec

A simple way to handle integration tests for AWS CDK projects. Cloud Spec is working on top of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and works with Typescript / Nodejs projects only at the moment.

## Example

- [Bucket](./test/aws-cdk/bucket/component.test.ts)

## Getting Started

TODO

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for CDK for Terraform
- [ ] Add support for Pulumi
- [ ] Multi Language support (i.e. Python)
